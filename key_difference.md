Sure! Here are the key differences between `Tkinter` and `CustomTkinter` in bullet points:
- `Tkinter` is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, while `CustomTkinter` is a python UI-library based on Tkinter.
- `CustomTkinter` provides new, modern, and fully customizable widgets that can be used in combination with normal Tkinter elements.
- The widgets and the window colors in `CustomTkinter` either adapt to the system appearance or the manually set mode ('light', 'dark').
- All `CustomTkinter` widgets and windows support HighDPI scaling (Windows, macOS).
- With `CustomTkinter`, you'll get a consistent and modern look across all desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

I hope this helps you understand the differences between `Tkinter` and `CustomTkinter`! ðŸ˜Š
